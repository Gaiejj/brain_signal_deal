# brain_signal_deal
brain_signal_deal in ai class in xjtu

如果没有问题，应该也是学弟学妹们逃不掉的实验，代码直接用就行了。

## Quick Start

```bash
cd brain_signal_deal
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd brain_signal_deal
python exp1.py
```

## Change Log

- feat: support exp1 results
- feat: support needed dataset (Please note that dataset/exp1/`DATA`.nii is too large to upload, so you need to download it from teachers and put it in the dataset/exp1 folder, where `DATA` can be aal, LCCN_mask, etc.)
- refactor: change the file layers
- refactor: use relative path instead of absolute path
